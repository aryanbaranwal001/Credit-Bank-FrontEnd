I want the following edits from you.

 First of all, navbar should be positioned in a way in which it always is present on the top and has different flow than rest of the website.

Structure the page plan (navbar position, classnames of div which encompasses the routes section, check when it is actually required or some other better thing can be done) which allow me to flexibly design the pages like given in routes route section, especially their background. 

Actually, design the following borrow page with the points I want (functional component name is borrow)

I want a bright blurred background like that of uniswap landing page.

it should include the randomly positioned token images which are at starting blurred and when hovered over them they become visible with rings around them which gives them a very hover like feel. TOKENS data have .img for image url.

also if you think something can be improved more in the borrow section, do it please
